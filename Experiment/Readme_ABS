Programs to run:

1) python3 CANBus_5.py

2) python3 Gateway.py (Running gateway separately because both ABS & TCS use case have this in common)

the receiver sockets calling:
3) python3 ABS_servers.py

the sender sockets calling:
4) python3 ABS_clients.py

press Brake_pedal GUI button to apply brake to activate ABS (default OFF).
For optimization, press auto random button.
Hydraulic_modulator will generate a GUI output for each value of the cycle to indicate ABS activation

If oserror occurs, type "sudo pkill python" in terminal and run again


Rafiul's flow in code-
        WheelSpeed_sensor ->
                                -> ABS_recv ->		  -> Hydraulic_modulator
              Brake_pedal ->                    ->  ABS_process
                             ADAS -> CANBus ->	         -> CANBus -> Gateway 



ADAS -- Provide Vehicle speed
CanBus -- Pass vehicle speed to ABS_process.py
ABS_recv -- Takes Wheel speed and brake pedal position
ABS_process -- Calculate slip rate and pressure change and send it to Hydraulic Modulator
Hydraulic Modulator -- Receives updated pressure from ABS
